# Save Walter White
As my first website, I decided to re-make the [easter egg website](http://www.savewalterwhite.com/) from AMC's popular show **Breaking Bad** and re-style it to a more minimalist/modern look.

4. [Easter Eggs](#easter-eggs)

## Introduction:
This is actually my 2nd take on this idea, because I ended up giving up on the first try 7 months ago. Before building this webpage, I had no prior experience with HTML & CSS, so I just googled my way through any obstacle and ended up learning a lot from this experience. It took me around 10 hours to finish the first (and current) version.

## Resources:
- The [original website](http://www.savewalterwhite.com/):
	I used it for the main text since I didn't wanna deviate completely from the main website and was only interested in changing the visuals.
- [W3S Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/):
	I used W3S Schools to learn everything I needed while creating this website, I was reading about CSS concepts I didn't know simultaneously while building the webpage.

## TODO List:
- Add a visitors counter.
- Add plenty of Easter Eggs.

## Easter Eggs:
- The **Donate Now** button takes you to the donation section of a local association of cancer control's website : [Fondation Lalla Salma De Lutte Contre Le Cancer](https://contrelecancer.ma/fr/).
- Other easter eggs are otw.
